There are many reasons why javascript has become the phenomenon it is now. It doesn't hurt that javascript is one of the easier programming languages to learn. One of the nice things about javascript is that the script is sent to the browser when you request an HTML page with Javascript. This means that your scripts can be seen and copied by whoever views your page. This is really useful for someone is learning javascript and would like to know how what javascript code was used to create such features on a site. Originally a language designed for dynamic front-end development when netscape navigator was the dominant browser choice, javascript has become a weapon for a full-stack developer. With the help of node.JS for back-end, we can now build scalable server-side and networking applications. Javascript is supported by all main stream browsers. Making it a very versatile language for the web. Code written in javascript is quick and responsive because it communicates well with the server. Javascript is multi-platform friendly, as internet usage is done through different mediums like tablets, e-readers, and smart phones, javascript will become even more ubiquitous. Lastly, another awesome bonus about Javascript are it's extensive libraries, which allow you borrow code. jQuery, one of the most popular libraries of javascript allows you easily manipulate web pages with just a few lines of code.
