To be honest, as an Asian American, stereotypes for the most part against us have been shown in a positive light, almost to an extreme. We are seen as the model minority. Known to be hardworking, politically inactive, studious, intelligent, productive, and inoffensive people who have elevated their social standing through merit and diligence. 

Because of this stereotype, there comes a high expectation that you're just suppose work hard, get good grades, go to college, and get a secure job. For the most part, I was able to follow the stereotype of what was expected up through college. I got good grades in school, was able to getting into one of the top public universities in the country, and receive a diploma with good GPA. 

But in the end, what was it all for? I've spent the last couple of years of after college, trying to figure out what I think I would enjoy doing, because I didn't get to figure that out through my entire education. My entire education experience was one of compliancy, rather than one of passion or love. I really feel like the standards of which I placed on myself through my life, now mean very little. 

The years spent memorize random crap that I would never use again just for the sakes of a pretty letter grade. It's slightly frustrated that I didn't really question why I spent my efforts on grades sooner. I guess I was just trying to live up my parents' expectations, as well as the expectations among other Asian peers. Why is getting good grades emphasize so much in Asian culture? And is this idea that your children's grades are the most important thing for a child growing up an outdated ideology? These are the questions I would like to raise. 

On the other hand, I don't know what I would have done, as a kid if I didn't spend as much time studying and worrying about my grades. I had no real passions or interests, besides the desire to spend more time playing video games. It's not as if, I could say I could have become this or that if I spent more time on it. It's more of a, I wished I spent more time exploring all the possibilities earlier. 

I grew up in a household where both my parents didn't go to college. I remember at the time I was applying for colleges and majors, I didn't really understand what engineers even did, even thou I was living basically in Silicon Valley. I didn't even know what Silicon Valley was particular known for. All I really knew was, that anything in the engineering field including computer science were more math intensive, and by my junior year of high school after going through calculus, I thought I really had enough of math. If anything I wished schools gave you a better exposure to all the variety of career choices. Well I'm still fortunate that it's not too late to pursue something I can passionate about, so I'm grateful.
