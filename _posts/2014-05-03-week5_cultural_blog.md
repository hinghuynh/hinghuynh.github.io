One of things that I hear about in Silicon Valley is how it's uncommon to be programming past your 40s. Similar to an athlete, it seems you are past your prime, and should be moved towards a management position if you still want to be working in the tech industry. This idea sounds a little frightening as I not going into the field fresh out of college. If there is such a cutoff for programmers in silicon valley, that would mean I would only have so many years left to pursue the craft of programming. I'd like to explore the possible reasons why this field seems to be intended for the young and youthful. 

One of the arguments presented is how the older people quite become obsolete by the frantic pace that tech industry evolves at. Languages that were once the standard by which the industry coded in are replaced other languages. Those who aren't able to adapt and learn these new languages are forced to take a management position or to leave their company. 

So is the statistics there to prove that programmers have a short career span or is it a myth. If one looks at the statistics from StackOverflow, they will find that the mode for age of users to be at 27. The average age of users is 29 with a standard deviation of 7 years. This shows that only 2.5% of StackOverflow users are over the age of 43. However, using statistics from the Bureau of Labor of Statistics, we get a slightly different picture. The median age for computer programmers is 42, 39 respectively for software developers, and 37 for web developers. This is still younger than the general labor force median age of 42, but not too significant in the sense that the old are well underrepresented. 

I think it's an overstatement to say that programmers have a short career span. I'm sure there are many older programmers who slip through the statistics, because they go on to found startups, where their title may change. Mature programmers, who have paid their dues, definitely have advantages in experience to fresher programmers. I believe as long one continues to spend time honing and updating their skills to keep up with the current technologies and trends, they can be a force to reckon with long into retirement age.
