This week I probably had the most fun doing my homework so far. I was pairing up almost every day of the week, it really got addictive to be able to collaborate with other minds to solve problems. 

I really love when people bring different strengths the table, it really allows efficient allocation of brain power when trying to solve a difficult problem. Generally if when I would get stuck while working alone, I would spend minutes just staring at my code, with no immediate answer. Which would end with break sessions hoping for random flashes of insight or I would spend a lot more time researching through trial and error. Whereas with other people, errors in our thought process were immediately noticed and corrected. Less time was spent thinking about the problem, and more time was spent writing, tinkering and modifying code. 

I generally like to ask a lot questions when working with other people, just because I like to know what the other members are thinking or where they would like to go or how they would like to approach. This works fine if some wants to lead and doesn t mind the questioning, but when it comes to members that are less inclined to have a personal preference, it may lead nowhere. Also I feel like my questioning may be construed in a negative way, which I hope isn t the case. I don t want other people to feel like they need to justify why they are doing things in a certain way, every time I ask a question. I only ask them in order to understand other peopleâ€™s thought process or where we are going with the problem, so that I may be of best use. 

I have not received any feedback yet, so I can t really comment on my feedback. I didn t really enjoy the process of writing feedback. I honestly don t like giving any advice when I find myself not in the optimal position to role model the advice that I give, which seems to be the case more often than not. It is not very difficult on pointing out what aspects someone excels at. The difficulty lies in trying to find things someone can work on. I really don t like writing negative comments on other people, but in order for one to learn what he needs to improve. There must be acknowledgment of flaws and weaknesses. Overall, I think feedback is used effectively can really help you grow and improve, if taken and implemented.
