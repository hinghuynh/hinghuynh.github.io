Which one should I use?

While Statement Loop

A While loop executes code while the conditional is true. To separate code from condition you can use do, a backslash, a newline, or a semicolon.

For Loop vs. Each Loop

A For Loop is pretty much the same as an each loop in terms of function and usage except that a For loop the local variables created in the loop cannot be called upon outside the loop. With a Each loop you can still call upon the local variable after the loop is completed.
