						<p class="heading">	A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with a Single Step - Laozi

						</p>
						<br>
						<br> <!-- &nbsp; -->
						<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back at my values that I wrote about in an earlier blog post, I&#39;ve noticed that thou I&#39;ve picked personal growth as the value I choose to be most important. It has probably been the thing that has caused me the most pain in my years since college.  I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;ve generally set my expectations way higher than the actual outcomes of my ambitions.  I&#39;d like to think most people tend to underestimate the time to takes to complete a big task or the time it takes make a certain amount of progress on a goal. There&#39;s a quote that I like by Michelangelo, &#34;The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.&#34;  I&#39;ve tried to live by these words, but often find myself wanting to give in.  That the aspirations I&#39;ve had were just not meant for me, at least not right now..						
						<br>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m waiting for the day, when I can say that the bullshit I&#39;ve gone through, all the time that I&#39;ve wasted and the hardships that I&#39;ve endured was worth it.  To say it was all worth it, because it got me to where I am, and where am I is where I wanted to be.  I don&#39;t know if that day will ever arrive or if I&#39;ll ever get close, but I&#39;m still hoping.  People say that life is about the journey and not the destination.  But sometimes it&#39;s just seems so hard when you are the character of your game of life.  But in this game, every time you think you&#39;ve made a little progress, you find yourself died and being force to start at the beginning of the game all over again.   
						<br>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, when all has been said, I&#39;m still thankful. I&#39;m thankful that I&#39;ve had wonderful parents, who have been supportive, despite my lack of accomplishments.  It pains me when, I hear my parents have conversations about how their children are doing, when the subject of me comes up, it&#39;s always been from the other end a vague implication of something along the lines of, &#34; So your son still hasn&#34;t gotten a real job yet?&#34;  My parents are too kind when they always respond in a way that gives me the benefit of the doubt.  It bites at my self-esteem to a point where it feels almost hollow. I want to be a son that my parents can speak proudly of, but I also want to live a life doing things I am passionate about.  I am hoping that one day, I can have both. And so as the days countdown till my flight to Chicago, one chapter of my life is closing, and I got the feeling that the next chapter going to be a lot better than the last one.
