<p>Hi, my name is Hing Huynh. I am currently 25 year olds and am currently working to pursue a career in software development.  I previously studied economics and accounting while I was in college at UCLA.  Since college I've pursued various careers as a realtor, loan officer, business broker, and a day trader.  It really wasn't until after college that I started dabbling in things that I started find what I had the vague interest in.  I'm hoping that as I spend more time learning to program that it will become more and more passionate about it.</p>

<p>A little about myself. I love to read.  I love to read non-fiction books related to business,self-development, and health and wellness, but also recently developed a recent addiction to sci-fi.  The most recent books that I've read are "Atlantis Gene" and "Atlantis Plague."  This is a wonderful sci-fi series written by A.G. Riddle.  A.G. Riddle beautifully intertwines real historical data with some fiction to create a thrilling series about fight between human extinction and evolution.  I highly recommend if you love sci-fi to check these books out. </p>
