						<p class="heading">	Dealing with Conflict
						</p>
						<br>
						<br> <!-- &nbsp; -->
						<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to conflict for me the easiest way for me to deal with it is generally to attack myself. I generally like to think of what all the possibilities of what I did wrong and what I could have done better.  However I noticed that, when I have the least amount of tolerance for annoyances when I&#39;m stress.  If tolerance is a form of will power, the more stressed I am, the less I can tolerate annoyances.  One of things that I struggle with is listening to mindless chatters that go nowhere.  My dad likes to talk, but most of the time when it talks he goes in circles and repeats things over and over.  When I&#39;m in a good mood, I will usually make the effort to listen. But if I&#39;ve had a rough day, then it becomes increasingly difficult to listen to his repetitive rants. 
						<br>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I&#39;ll shout things like that&#39;s enough, please stop talking, or I get it, you don&#39;t need to explain it. Which will usually stop him in the middle of his rant.  I know when I do this, it hurts his feelings, but it feelslike a natural impulse sometimes. My natural inclination of blurting something rude to make him stop talking feels overwhelming at times.  I know in end we&#39;ll both feel worse, because of my sudden need to end his conversation short. And I will usually end up regretting it.  Despite how simple-minded my dad is, I love my father. He&#39;s a good father, and he deserves at least a son who will listen to what he has to say.  
						<br>
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is always going to be hard, but it&#39;s our decision on how we choose to react to it.  Maintaining composure in times of difficulty is a true test of our will power, but I feel these are most important times of when we try our hardest to withstand shouting in anger, rage, or annoyance.  The act of self-control is a skill I heavily seek to improve, but it is only in the practice of it, that I will actually get better at it.
